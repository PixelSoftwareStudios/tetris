## Tetris in Python

This project was started on April 21st, 2023, after I watched the Tetris movie. What a good movie. Absolutely inspiring.  
In that movie, they show the original version of Tetris made by Alexey Pajitnov.
This is inspired by that version.  
I also watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVSGssuUbXo) to see the gameplay.

Right now, it is very basic and only has simple block movement.
It also prints each frame to stdout.
I will eventually use curses to make it like a real game and allow arrow key movement.
Maybe even use the playsound module to play the tetris theme
