Tetris in python

This project was started on April 21st, 2023, after I watched the Tetris movie. What a good movie. Absolutely inspiring.
In that movie, they show the original version of Tetris made by Alexey Pajitnov.
This is inspired by that version.

Right now, it is very basic and only has simple block movement.
It also prints each frame to stdout.
I will eventually use curses to make it smoother.
